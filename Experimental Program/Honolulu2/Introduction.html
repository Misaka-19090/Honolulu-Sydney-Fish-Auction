<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>

<div class="section">
    {{ if subsession.is_dutch_first == 0 }}
    <p class="newsection">
        In this part you are going to participate in a sequence of independent auction periods in which you will be buying a fictitious good. At the beginning of each auction, you will be assigned to a market with <strong>{{ num_other }}</strong> other participant(s). You will not be told which of the other participants are in your market. <em>What happens in your market has no effect on the participants in other markets and vice versa.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        In each auction period you will be able to place bids in an auction to purchase a single unit of a good.
    </p>
    {{ else }}
    <p class="newsection">
        In this part of the experiment, you are going to participate in another sequence of independent auction periods in which you will be buying a fictitious good. Your earnings from the purchase will depend on your value, the price you pay, and the auction duration, just like in the previous part. However, the auction organization will be different.

        <b>Values and Earnings</b> During each market period you are free to purchase a unit of a good in an auction. You will be assigned a number which describes the value of the good for you. These values may differ among bidders and market periods. Each bidder will receive a value between <strong>{{ C.PRICE_MIN }}</strong> and <strong>{{ C.PRICE_MAX }}</strong>, with each number being equally likely. <em>You are not to reveal your value to anyone. It is your own private information.</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Your earnings from the purchase, which are yours to keep, will depend on the difference between your value for the good and the price you pay, and on how long the auction lasts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Your raw (unadjusted) earnings or loss from the purchase is equal to the difference between your value and the purchase price:</em> That is: 
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
        YOUR UNADJUSTED EARNINGS = YOUR VALUE - PURCHASE PRICE.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Example 1</b> (All values are hypothetical). If you buy a good for {{ ex1_bid }} points and your value is {{ ex1_val }}, then your unadjusted earnings are:
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
        UNADJUSTED EARNINGS = {{ ex1_val }} - {{ ex1_bid }} = {{ ex1_uadj }} points.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Example 2</b> If you buy the good for {{ ex2_bid }} points and your value is {{ ex2_val }}, then your unadjusted earnings are:

    <p class="newsection">
        <b>Auction Duration and Earnings</b> <em>Your earnings will further decrease in proportion to how long the auction lasts.</em> The auction duration will be measured by the virtual clock, which will tick every <strong>{{ tick }}</strong> seconds while the auction is open. Your unadjusted earnings, if positive, will shrink by <strong>{{ pct_b }}</strong> percent with every tick of the virtual clock; your loss, if negative, will increase by <strong>{{ pct_b }}</strong> percent with every tick of the virtual clock.

    <p>
        If, on the other hand, the auction ends after {{ tick69 }} ticks, your earnings will shrink to {{ ex1_pct_69 }} percent by the end of the auction, and your time-adjusted earnings will be:

        <b>Example 2 continued</b> Suppose, as in Example 2 above, that your value is {{ ex2_val }}, you buy the good for {{ ex2_bid }}, and the time-adjustment factor is as given. If the auction ends after {{ tick13 }} ticks of the virtual clock, then your loss from the purchase will grow in magnitude by {{ ex2_pct_13 }} percent, and you adjusted earnings (loss) will be:

        TIME-ADJUSTED EARNINGS = ({{ ex2_val }} - {{ ex2_bid }}) * {{ ex2_discount_13 }} = {{ ex2_adj_13 }} points.
    </p>
    <p>
        If, on the other hand, your value and the purchase price are the same as above, but the auction ends after {{ tick69 }} ticks, then your loss from the purchase will increase by {{ ex2_pct_69 }} percent. Your time-adjusted negative earnings will be:
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
        TIME-ADJUSTED EARNINGS = ({{ ex2_val }} - {{ ex2_bid }}) * {{ ex2_discount_69 }} = {{ ex2_adj_69 }} points.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not buy the good in a given period, your earnings will be zero in this period irrespective of how long the auction lasts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At each point of time during the auction, your computer screen will display your value of the good, the current price at which you may buy, the time adjustment factor, and your unadjusted and time-adjusted payoffs (earnings or losses) if you were to buy the good at the current price and time.

<h3>
    Auction Organization
</h3>

<div class="section">
    <p class="newsection">
        The auction is organized as follows. In each auction you and <strong>{{ num_other }}</strong> other participant(s) will compete to purchase a fictitious good.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Price is going down</b> The price of the good will start at some value between <strong>{{ C.PRICE_MIN }}</strong> and <strong>{{ C.PRICE_MAX }}</strong> points, set by the experimenter, and will go down by <strong>1</strong> point with every tick of the virtual clock. Any of the bidders can stop the auction and provisionally purchase the good at the price displayed on the screen by clicking the <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> button. The first person to click the <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> button is provisionally assigned the good at the given price and time. The provisional buyer's screen will look like this: 
    </p>
    <img src="{{ static '02_Contest_DutchWinner.png' }}">
    <p>
        <b>Another chance to bid</b> When a bidder bids and becomes a provisional buyer, other bidders have <strong>{{ C.CONTEST_TIME }}</strong> seconds to challenge the provisional buyer by clicking the <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> button. The virtual clock will stop, and bidder payoffs will not change, during this time. Their screens will look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="{{ static '03_Contest_DutchNonWinner.png' }}">
    <p>
        If a bidder decides not to bid at this stage, they may leave the auction by either clicking <strong class="s_leave">Leave</strong> button, or by taking no action. This bidder then becomes inactive and cannot bid any more.
    </p>
    <p>
        If no bidder challenges the provisionally assigned buyer by clicking the <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> button after <strong>{{ C.CONTEST_TIME }}</strong> seconds, then the auction ends. The provisional buyer buys the good at the price and time of their bid. All other bidders earn 0 for that auction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Price is going up</b> If one or more other bidders challenge the provisional buyer by clicking the <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> button, then the auction and the virtual clock will resume, and the price will go up from the previously bid price by <strong>1</strong> point with every tick of the virtual clock. Only the provisional buyer and those bidders who challenged this buyer by clicking <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> will be active in the auction at this stage. (The bidders who left the auction will be inactive and will view the auction without taking any action.) An active bidder screen will look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="{{ static '05_English.png' }}">
    <p>
        Any active bidder can then leave the auction at any time by clicking the <strong class="s_leave">Leave</strong> button. The auction will continue, with the price and time increasing, as long as there are two or more active bidders in the auction. The auction ends when the next to the last active bidder clicks <strong class="s_leave">Leave</strong> button. The last bidder to stay active in the auction buys the good at the price and time when the next to last bidder left. All other bidders earn 0 for that auction. If two last active bidders drop out at the same time and price, then the object will be allocated randomly to one of these bidders at the price and time when they left.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the good is sold, the auction closes for this period. Your results screen will display whether you bought the good or not; your value for the good, sale price, and your unadjusted and time-adjusted payoffs. 
    </p>
    {{ if subsession.is_dutch_first == 0 }}
    <img src="{{ static '07_Result_Winner.png' }}">
    <p>
        If you do not buy, your results screen will report your actual payoffs as zero, and will also display your hypothetical payoff if you were to buy the good at the price and time when it was sold:
    </p>
    <img src="{{ static '08_Result_NonWinner.png' }}">
    {{ endif }}
    <p>
        Your time-adjusted earnings from all previous auctions will be displayed in the history box at the bottom of each auction's results screen.

<h3>
    Summary of Auction Organization
</h3>

<div class="section strongsection">
    <p class="newsection">1. When the auction opens, the price will start to go down. The first person to click the <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> button will be provisionally assigned the good at the time and price of their bid. After that, all other bidders will be given another chance to bid.</p>
    <p class="newsection">2. Only the bidders who click <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong>, either when the price is going down, or at "Another Chance to Bid" stage, will have a chance to buy. Bidders who do not bid will not be able to buy the good in this auction and will earn zero.</p>
    <p class="newsection">3. If more than one bidder clicks the <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> button, the price will start going up, and all bidders who are active (i.e., they pressed <strong class="s_bid">Bid</strong> earlier) will be considered willing to buy at the current price. You have to press the <strong class="s_leave">Leave</strong> button to exit bidding. The last bidder to stay active in the auction will buy the good at the price and time when the next to last bidder left.</p>
    <p class="newsection">4. If the price is above your value, and you bid (if the price is going down or at "Another Chance to Bid" stage) or you do not leave the auction (if the price is going up), you may end up buying the good at a price above your value, and lose money.</p>
    <p class="newsection">5. If the price is below your value and you do not bid (at "Another Chance to Bid" stage), or you leave the auction (when the price is going up), you may forgo a chance to buy at a price below your value and earn a positive profit.</p>
