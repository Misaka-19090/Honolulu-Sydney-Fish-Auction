# Behavioral Surveys

Experimental auctions were preceded by a three-part behavioral survey. Part 1 assesses participants' cognitive abilities using ICAR tests as given in (Condon et al, 2014). Parts 2 and 3 contain staircase risk and time preference tasks adopted from (Falk et al, 2016). This part takes about $10$ minutes.

Each auction part is followed by a short survey assessing participant affective states and their feedback on the auction institution. 

Each experimental session concludes with a short questionnaire containing qualitative questions on individual competitiveness.

## Pre-experiment survey

**Survey Section 1:** This section will contain five questions and you are given up to one minute to answer each question, taking approximately five minutes for this section. A $3 \times 3$ matrix of patterns will be presented to you and you will be asked to indicate the best answer to complete the figure. 

Note that each question defaults to "No Answer" if no response is given within the time frame. 

[Survey Section 1 (Cognitive Abilities) employed five matrix reasoning questions given to participants are MR.43 -- MR.47, as can be assessed through https://icar-project.com/.]
